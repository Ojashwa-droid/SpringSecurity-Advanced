# üõ°Ô∏èüåø Spring Security Advanced

Repository for advanced Spring Security concepts including:
- **JWT Authentication & Authorization**
- **Method Level Security**
- **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**
- **Keycloak Integration**

## Sections

### Section 11 ‚Üí JWT
This section covers:
- Generating JWT tokens (JwtTokenGeneratorFilter)
- Validating tokens (JwtTokenValidatorFilter)
- Integrating JWT with Spring Security filters
- Securing REST APIs with JWT (Till now: BasicAuthN + Jwt)
- Publishing Authentication Manager for custom authentication (Without BasicAuthN, credentials in requestBody for safer authN) 

**Folder:** `section11/springsecsection11`

---

### Section 12 ‚Üí Method Level Security
This section covers: 1. Invocation Authorization 2. Filtering Authorization
- `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize`
- Role-based access control on methods
- Using SpEL (Spring Expression Language) for fine-grained security rules
- Combining method security with global security configurations
- `@PreFilter` and `@PostFilter`
- Controlling what specific parameters are sent and reieved from the annotated method

**Folder:** `section12/springsecsection12`

---

### üîë Section 14 ‚Üí OAuth2.0 Social Login (SSR-style)
This section covers: Social Login via github and facebook (in Spring MVC demo application). We integrate **OAuth2.0 social logins** (e.g., GitHub, Facebook, Google) into a Spring Security application.  

- Configuring a custom SecurityFilterChain Bean
- Bean of ClientRegistrationRepository 
- Registering and utilizing clients (github, facebook)

### Section 15 ‚Üí Oauth2.0 with Keycloak Identity & Access Management (IAM) üõ°Ô∏è

In this section, we integrate **Keycloak** as our centralized **Authentication and Authorization server**.  

üîë What is Keycloak?
Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that provides:
- Single Sign-On (SSO)  
- User federation (connect with LDAP/Active Directory)  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Instead of managing users and roles directly in our application, we **delegate all IAM responsibilities to Keycloak**.  
This makes our backend application act as a **Resource Server**, while Keycloak plays the role of **Authorization Server**.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works in my Project
1. **Keycloak Server Setup**  
   - A realm is created in Keycloak (e.g., `my-app-realm`).  
   - Clients are registered in the realm (e.g., `postman-client`).  
   - Users are created/registered and roles are defined and assigned to users.  

2. **Spring Boot Integration**  
   - We configure our backend as a **Resource Server**.  
   - It validates JWT tokens issued by Keycloak (opaque tokens are kept as a option as well) 
   - Access to APIs is controlled based on roles/permissions defined in Keycloak and authroized in our resource server (SprinngBoot Application).  

3. **Authentication Flow**  
   - The user logs in through Keycloak‚Äôs login page.  
   - Keycloak authenticates the user and issues an **access token**.  
   - The token is passed in the `Authorization` header to our Spring Boot backend.  
   - The backend validates the token and grants/denies access to resources.  

## üèóÔ∏è Benefits
- Centralized authentication & authorization  
- No need to store passwords in the backend  
- Easy integration with modern security standards (OAuth2, OIDC)  
- Supports enterprise features like SSO and user federation  

‚úÖ With Keycloak, our application is now **enterprise-ready** with secure, standards-based Identity and Access Management.
